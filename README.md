# Mouse Jitter AFK Bypass

This mod adds a "Mouse Jitter" feature to prevent AFK detection in Duet Night Abyss. It works by periodically moving the mouse cursor slightly when the game is in the background or foreground.
Also include Log Deleter that automatically deletes log files generated by Duet Night Abyss to prevent detection and potential bans.

## Features

*   **Non-Disruptive**: Checks if the mouse is in the game window before jittering. If the mouse is outside, it centers it first.
*   **Configurable**: You can enable/disable it and set the jitter interval in the task settings.
*   **Relative Movement**: Uses relative mouse movement to ensure compatibility with game camera controls.

## Supported Tasks

*   **Auto Commission** (CommissionsTask)
*   **Auto Fish** (AutoFishTask)
*   **Auto Exploration** (AutoExploration / AutoExploration_Fast)
*   **Auto Dungeon** (ImportTask)
*   **Auto Defence** (AutoDefence - via inheritance)
*   **Auto 70jjb** (Auto70jjbTask - via inheritance)
*   **Auto Skill** (AutoSkill - via inheritance)

## Installation

1.  Copy the `.py` files from this folder to your `ok-dna/src/tasks/` directory (and subdirectories as appropriate).
    CommissionsTask.py -> src/tasks/    
    AutoExploration.py -> src/tasks/  
    AutoDefence.py -> src/tasks/   
    AutoExpulsion.py -> src/tasks/
    
    AutoFishTask.py -> src/tasks/fullauto/
    
    AutoExploration_Fast.py -> src/tasks/fullauto/
    
    ImportTask.py -> src/tasks/fullauto/
    
    Optional files
    
    AutoEscortTask.py -> src/tasks/fullauto/
    Auto70jjbTask.py -> src/tasks/fullauto/
    Auto65ArtifactTask_Fast.py -> src/tasks/fullauto/
    AutoHedge.py -> src/tasks/
    AutoGeneral.py -> src/tasks/
    AutoExcavation.py -> src/tasks/
    
    
*   **AutoExploration_Fast.py**: Updated with map detection logging and jitter logic.

# Log Deleter (`log_deleter.py`)

A standalone utility script that automatically deletes log files generated by Duet Night Abyss to prevent detection and potential bans. Can use as a launcher since it will delete the logs, and able to launch OK-DNA and DNA game. 

## Features

*   **Auto-Detection**: Automatically finds game installation and executable paths
*   **Multiple Deletion Modes**:
    *   **Once**: Delete logs once and exit (run before starting game)
    *   **Continuous**: Delete logs every 100ms (maximum safety during gameplay)
    *   **Periodic**: Delete logs every N minutes (balanced approach)
*   **Auto-Launch**: Optionally launches the game and ok-dna.exe when starting deletion
*   **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface with path validation
*   **Config Persistence**: Remembers your settings (paths, preferences) for next time

## What It Does

The script continuously monitors and deletes the following log folders:
*   `Logs` - Game log files
*   `PcUsdk\log` - SDK log files
*   `Config\CrashReportClient` - Crash report data

**Note**: `SaveGames` folder is explicitly excluded and never deleted.

## Usage

**GUI Mode (Recommended)**:
1. Double-click `log_deleter.py` to open the GUI.
2. Select your deletion mode (Once/Continuous/Periodic).
3. Optionally configure auto-launch settings.
4. Click "Start Deletion".

**Command Line Mode**:
```bash
# Delete once and exit
python log_deleter.py once

# Continuous deletion (100ms interval)
python log_deleter.py continuous

# Periodic deletion (every 5 minutes)
python log_deleter.py periodic --interval 5
```

## Configuration

Settings are saved to `log_deleter_config.json` in the same directory:
*   Game installation path
*   Game executable path
*   ok-dna.exe path

*   Launch enabled/disabled state
